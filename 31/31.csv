The best headphones have ever used in my life. Apple have maintained that class in building these Airpods. Connectivity is too fast in iPhones. It will fit in the ears and you even forget it’s in your ears. With a decent battery back up. And flipkart delivery was pretty fast.</div><span class=""_1H-bmy""><span>READ MORE</span></span></div></div>"
